# Day 1: SQL Fundamentals for Automation

## Skills Acquired
- SQLite installation and basic navigation
- Database design for automation scenarios
- Complex queries with JOINs for data correlation
- Pattern matching with LIKE for log processing

## Key SQL Concepts Mastered

### Basic Operations
- CREATE TABLE with realistic constraints
- INSERT sample data for testing
- SELECT with WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY

### Advanced Queries
- INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN (correlation vs complete picture)
- Pattern matching with LIKE and wildcards (% for any characters)
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG) for reporting

### Real-World Applications
- Server monitoring and alerting
- Log processing and pattern recognition
- Multi-table data correlation for troubleshooting

## Databases Created
1. `automation_logs.db` - Practice database with server monitoring
2. `log_processing_system.db` - Custom log automation scenario

## Key Insight
JOINs help correlate data across systems - critical for platform engineering where you need to connect server metrics, job status, and alert data to solve problems efficiently.

## Next: Day 2 Advanced SQL Operations
Focus on complex JOINs and data transformation for automation workflows.
